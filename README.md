# Hi there!

I'm a metal singer with 10+ years of software/cloud engineering experience.

Currently living in Northern Europe and working at **GitHub** (you are looking at it).

"I like to define myself as a **jack of most (tech) trades, master of some**."

| 📖 🔮 | **[Fire Tools](https://github.com/mbianchidev/fire-tools)** | Your personal finance copilot, without AI. | Low. <br> A hobby project that will substitute the current Google Sheet setup for my personal finance. |
