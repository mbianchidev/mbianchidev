## 🚀 Current Projects

*Things I'm working on, aside from my main job*

### 🎵 High Effort
| Icon | Project | Description |
|:----:|---------|-------------|
| ☕ | **Music** | Playing and recording music with my band. Best way to spend many hours of my free time. |

### ⚙️ Medium Effort
| Icon | Project | Description |
|:----:|---------|-------------|
| 💸 | **Consulting** | Infrastructure/Architecture with a focus on Kubernetes, Hiring, Product Market Fit & Go To Market, Open Source Strategy. Depends on the period. |
| 📖 | **[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)** | It's running this and other website/apps you look at every single day. A couple hours per week, doing maintainance and improving processes. |

### 🔧 Low Effort
| Icon | Project | Description |
|:----:|---------|-------------|
| 💸 | **[Mentoring engineers](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/matteobianchi/)** | Reach out on MentorCruise, or my LinkedIn if you want to be mentored by me, easy. I only take a few mentees at a time. |
| 📖 🔮 | **[Fire Tools](https://github.com/mbianchidev/fire-tools)** | Your personal finance copilot, without AI. A hobby project that will substitute the current Google Sheet setup for my personal finance. |
| 📖 🔮 | **[Engineering Interviews](https://github.com/mbianchidev/engineering-interviews)** | A simple platform to practice for engineering interviews, focused on System Design, Engineering and conversational interview. I sometimes add questions here, especially when I spar-interview. |
| 📖 | **[Platform Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/mbianchidev/platform-engineering-roadmap)** | An opinionated way to get to be a Platform Engineer, in the form of a roadmap.sh style website. I will probably donate it to a Platform Engineering community at some point. |

### 💭 Almost Zero Effort
| Icon | Project | Description |
|:----:|---------|-------------|
| ☕ | **[My new satiric website](https://github.com/mbianchidev/mock-startup-website)** | I pretended to have a startup with a cool product (me) and I am absolutely mocking YC founders with this, yes. One day I'll actually buy a new domain and publish it. |
| 📖 🔮 | **[Find-concerts.io](https://github.com/mbianchidev/find-concerts-io)** | I want to build a concert discovery service that doesn't suck, unlike Songkick or Bandsintown (somewhat). Gotta find time to work on this. |
