#### Hi there!

My name is Matteo but my nicknames are many, depending on the many context you find me in (gaming? reddit? music?).

I'm an Engineer, living in Europe, currently working as DevRel. I speak at conferences (not necessarily being a speaker, I like to host as well) and sometimes I have fun as Cloud Native Consultant and Trainer.
I [blog](content-creation/blog/blog.md) about tech and life.
I organize tech events and meetups in the Netherlands, KubeTrain and contribute to Cloud Native in any way I can, currently shadowing comms for Kubernetes v.1.31

I like to define myself as a jack of most trades, master of some.

#### Quotes I try to live by

- "If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything." - _Ronald Coase_ 

This basically thought me to not fully believe data unless I know context and how it has been collected.

- The best code is no code at all. - [_Coding Horror blog_](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/)

I think this is self-explanatory but I'll add that before writing new code I always ask myself: "Is there a way to do this without writing (a lot of) code?". Answer is usually open-source, SaaS or adapt pre-existing code. Still, I try to keep my code as simple as possible following KISS, DRY and YAGNI principles.

- "Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind." - _Brene Brown_

I try to be as clear as possible when communicating with people, with little or no space for ambiguity. I also try to be kind, but I'm not always perceived as such, truth hurts sometimes.

- "Homines dum docent discunt." / Humans learn while they teach. - _Seneca_

I learn a lot by teaching, I'm a teacher at heart and I love to share my knowledge and experience with others.

#### Long story (never) short

<details>
  <summary>Are you sure? It's really long. TLDR; I like to build stuff</summary>

  I have always been passionate about computers and technology, but I started to code when I was 15, after switching highschool from a scientific and mostly theoretical one to what in Italy is called "technical" high school, where I learned the basics of programming and computer science üë®‚Äçüíª.
  
  I was never a good student, I was always bored by school ü•± and I never liked to study, but I was always curious and I loved to learn new things, especially if they were related to computers.
  My professors at that time used to tell me that I would never work in IT because I was not good enough, but I never gave up and I kept learning on my own ü§ì.
  
  Most people in my life were also not happy about my choice, they wanted me to go to university and get a degree to go for a "real job" ü§® instead of "playing with computers", but I was not interested in that, I wanted to work and learn by doing, not by studying.
  
  I started my professional journey in 2015 as a web developer, I started to write production grade PHP code even before I got my driving license. üöó 
  As employee I started as fullstack, in a small company building embedded software in C and some intarnal tools in C#, then I joined a promising local startup, always as fullstack but back to PHP with a Laravel flavor.
  
  Graduating from my high school I then moved to a bigger city (Milan), switched language to specialize in Java and built my back(end) as a Software Engineer, I climbed the ladder, worked on large scale products (8+ million users) and finally became a Senior Software Engineer. üë∑
  
  Since I am a fundamentally lazy person, I learnt to love automation, starting with bash scripts and moving on to DevOps tools and practices.
  I joined the Dark Side of DevOps and Site Reliability taking the best from my SWE background (I've never stopped to use the --force). üåå
  
  At some point, after leading DevOps initatives and bringing multiple teams from 0 to GitOps, I felt that I reached a ceiling in my career both in the company I worked at that time and in the italian IT landscape (not so rich, if you ask me). 
  That is the reason why I decided to start my journey in 2021 as a freelance professional and digital nomad. ‚úàÔ∏èüèùÔ∏è
  I wanted to scale my impact on the IT industry and to help more people and companies to achieve their goals. ‚õ∞Ô∏è
  
  I coached and mentored my padawans (ehm I mean, my students) about DevOps principles and practices. I also helped companies to improve their DevEx and DevOps approach. üìö
  
  In the meantime I learnt a bit more about frontend, especially React. I always despised Javascript but after learning about Typescript I started to like it a bit more. Still not my jam but I can live with it. Nodejs is more fun than I expected, I'll give you that. üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  
  Back to the story, in all this time I've been in the IT industry, I've learned a lot from hands on experience and had the opportunity to interact with truly amazing people. ü§ù
  
  After digital nomading across Europe, in 2023 I took the next step and I've become the CTO of a startup for one year, where I enjoyed the challenge of building a new company culture, a service and a product from scratch and of course taking care of my team. ü§ü
  
  In the end we could not find the Product-Market Fit and had to step back, but quoting Yoda: "The greatest teacher, failure is."
  
  I keep advocating for Cloud Native technologies, I am a Kubernetes lover and part of the CNCF community. ‚ò∏Ô∏èüíô
  I strongly believe in the power of Platform Engineering and I look forward to impact the IT industry with my work. üèãÔ∏è
  
  What will I do in 2024 and beyond? Who knows! ü§©
