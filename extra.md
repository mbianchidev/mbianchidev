#### Fun facts unrelated to tech

In my teenage years I had the opportunity to try out different jobs:

- Piercer
- Bartender
- Beach lifeguard
- Fast food worker
- Security/Bouncer - clubs, concerts, music festivals
- Pizza delivery guy
- Music events PR and organizer (wish I was still doing this)

Some of these I didn't like that much, but each of them taught me something and played a role in shaping who I am today.
