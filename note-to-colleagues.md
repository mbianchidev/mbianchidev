# User Manual: How to work with me

Heya there future (or current) colleague! 👋

This is a manual to help you understand how to work with me.
Please use he/him pronouns when referring to me, thanks!

I have good intentions most of the time, but being a non-native English speaker I might come across as dry or rude. Let me know if I do, I am on my way to improve!

## Who am I?

I consider myself a very friendly person, I love to help people and I'm always happy to do so.
Only problem is that especially when we first meet I'm quite shy and introverted, so I might not be the most talkative person in the room. Give me some time and I will open up!

If you want to find some common topics to talk about, here's a list of things I like: [here](extra.md)

I'm very passionate about my job and I love to share my knowledge with others as well as learning from others. I usually have a lot of questions and I'm not afraid to ask them (even if they might sound stupid).

- I care about climate change and I'm trying to do my part to help the planet. 🌱
- I'm an ally of the LGBTQ+ community and I'm trying to educate myself more on the topic. 🏳️‍🌈
- I care deeply about social issues and human rights but I might not be vocal about it on the job, mostly to avoid retaliation. ✊ 

Generally speaking, I don't want to talk politics or religion at work. I'm really not interested in chatting about that.

## Screaming

I can't stand people (regardless of their role in the company) screaming at me. I'm a human being, not a machine. I have feelings and emotions.
I will **never** scream at you, I expect the same from you.

If you're angry it's completely valid. You need to take a break, go for a walk, do something else, then come back and we will talk about it. ❤️

Btw I can scream at a higher volume than you, here's [proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqukHybn6zg) 😂

## Touching 

I really don't like to be touched, unless I explicitly gave consent for it. 
I'm not a hugger on the job unless we know each other really well. I'm a handshaker, high-fiver and a fist-bumper!

I also don't like if you touch my stuff without asking or when I'm not around. I will notice.

## Context

Are you asking me a question? Context.

Are you giving me specific information about something? Context first!

Are you asking me to do something? Context (and your subjective urgency evaluation), please.

Context is love, context is life.

## Communication

- Email ✅ - I usually check it twice a day (morning and afternoon)
- Slack ✅ - Love them messages and huddles, I check it after every meeting and if I have none - every 2 hours, unless I'm in a deep work status.
- Phone (work) ✅ - I reply if I am on-call or if it's an emergency, otherwise I will call you back when I'm available
- Phone (personal) ❌ - Quite difficult that I give away my personal number - sorry, I separate 99.999% (yes, those are three nines) work and personal life - In case you have my personal it means I'm fond of you so please don't call me for work-related stuff.
- Jira or similar tracking software 🟡 - I might be involved in 20+ tasks/topics/threads/streams/PRs at the same time... Please message me on Slack or send me an email if you need me to do or check something, a mention won't work to get my attention in a timely fashion and if it did in the past you were being lucky.

Sidenote: in the unfortunate case you use Teams I will _highly_ recommend you to switch to Slack instead, waaay better.

Mattermost is not bad either but it's still an extra software to install, Slack is standard c'mon.

## Hello

See: [No hello manifesto](https://nohello.net/en)

Examples:

"Hello Matteo, how are you? I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I have a question about our Kubernetes cluster. I'm trying to deploy a new API Gateway with our internal operator but I'm getting an error, find the logs attached. Can you help me?"

- Polite ✅
- Straight to the point ✅
- Context ✅

"There's something wrong with that new k8s operator, we need to fix it ASAP."

- Polite ✅ - yep, I consider it polite even without an "hello", it's an emergency!
- Straight to the point ✅
- Context ✅

"Hello Matteo" and then disappearing until I reply

- Waste of time for the both of us ❌

"Hey Matteo, just wanted to say hi, long time no chat huh? Did you move in the end?"
"Hello Matteo, have you watched the new episode of [insert TV series here]?"

- Non-work related 🟡 - I'll take my time to reply, thanks for messaging!

## Meetings

### All-hands / City Hall or whatever they call them these days

First of all: 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
If it's a 1-way broadcast it can be a video, right? 
I'll be eternally grateful if you let me consume it whenever I have time that day or the day after.

### 1:1

Love them regardless of being the manageR or the manageD.
Once a month works.

### Big Group Meetings

Unless necessary, I try to avoid group meetings. I prefer async communication, it's more efficient and it allows us to focus on getting the actual work done.

If you feel the need to involve me in a group meeting be sure to send me an agenda and set a clear expectation for my contribution.
I will join in time and I'll be super happy to help you!

Don't take it personal if I decline. Typical reasons are:
- Missing agenda, update it and send me a message about it.
- Conflicting meeting and yours was deemed to have a lesser priority/urgency, reschedule if you can.
- I don't know who you are / we don't work together so I assume you added me by mistake, shit happens!
- There are already people smarter than me that can serve my same purpose/role, sorry but I would be redundant and not helpful.
- It's out of my working hours, I usually start around 10 AM until 5:30 PM (time zone based)
- I'm off that day, 99% of the time I have set an Out of Office event but you probably didn't notice it.

Btw rule of thumb: if you can solve or decide about something without me, do it, I trust you. If I happen to be your lead/manager just send me a recap message afterwards.

### Working group / "War" room

Necessary evil, let's do it and get stuff done so we can get back on track and I can unpause Spotify.

### Random meetings

In case you just wanna chat about random stuff with me I would **love** to have a (virtual or real) coffee break together! ☕

## Deep Work

See: [Deep Work](files/deep-work.pdf)

## Bureaucracy

I hate bureaucracy. Strong word, I know but I really hate it with all my heart. I will do my very best to avoid it at all costs.

As you could've guessed, I don't cope well with it and it makes me feel like I'm wasting my and company time by not doing anything useful.

Avoid forcing me to do it if you can, I will be forever grateful and I will stay in your company for way longer.

## Feedback

### Receiving

I struggle with receiving positive feedback. I'm not used to it and I don't know how to react to it. I'm working on it.

I love constructive (negative) feedback, I'm always trying to improve myself and I'm happy to receive actionable feedback on how to do it. - 
e.g. "You should improve your content delivery" - not actionable; "You should improve your content delivery, by adding examples when you explain something technical, plus some sort of scheme and image" - perfect.

I will ask for a lot of advice rather than feedback, I'm more comfortable with that and I find that people naturally come up with something actionable when asked for advice.

### Giving

I think it's easy for me to be honest, I can sometime avoid telling you something to find the right time and place but if I ever gave you a feedback it rarely comes from an impulsive thought.
I constantly elaborate information and my brain hardly stops, so yeah, try to not take it personal and I'll do my best to not hurt your feelings.

Please tell me if I do.

E.g. if your code is being crappy lately I will just tell you "hey, this code is crap" - but I won't ever think or tell that **YOU** are. You didn't see my code from 2017. Thanks God.

## Mistakes

I won't blame anyone personally for making mistakes, unless it's myself. I make a lot of them, dang. 
I ask you tell me if I do something wrong and in return I will try to learn and make the most out your feedback. If we are not making mistakes we are not learning.

Note: If you try to gaslight me I will totally get mad.

p.s. If we have a good relationship I might make fun of you for making a mistake, but I will do it in a friendly way and expect you to do the same, I promise! 🤝
