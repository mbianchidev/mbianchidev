# User Manual: How to work with me

Heya there future (or current) colleague! üëã

This is a manual to help you understand how to work with me.
Please use he/him pronouns when referring to me, thanks!

I have good intentions most of the time, but being a non-native English speaker I might come across as dry or rude. Let me know if I do, I am on my way to improve!

## Who am I?

I consider myself a very friendly person, I love to help people and I'm always happy to do so.
Only problem is that especially when we first meet I'm quite shy and introverted, so I might not be the most talkative person in the room. Give me some time and I will open up!

If you want to find some common topics to talk about, here's a list of things I like: [here](extra.md)

I'm very passionate about my job and I love to share my knowledge with others as well as learning from others. I usually have a lot of questions and I'm not afraid to ask them (even if they might sound stupid).

- I care about climate change and I'm trying to do my part to help the planet. üå±
- I'm an ally of the LGBTQ+ community and I'm trying to educate myself more on the topic. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
- I care deeply about social issues and human rights but I might not be vocal about it on the job, mostly to avoid retaliation. ‚úä 

Generally speaking, I don't want to talk politics or religion at work. I'm really not interested in chatting about that.

## Screaming

I can't stand people (regardless of their role in the company) screaming at me. I'm a human being, not a machine. I have feelings and emotions.
I will **never** scream at you, I expect the same from you.

If you're angry it's completely valid. You need to take a break, go for a walk, do something else, then come back and we will talk about it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Btw I can scream at a higher volume than you, here's [proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqukHybn6zg) üòÇ

## Touching

I really don't like to be touched, unless I explicitly gave consent for it. 
I'm not a hugger on the job unless we know each other really well. I'm a handshaker, high-fiver and a fist-bumper!

I also don't like if you touch my stuff without asking or when I'm not around. I will notice.

## Context

Are you asking me a question? Context.

Are you giving me specific information about something? Context first!

Are you asking me to do something? Context (and your subjective urgency evaluation), please.

Context is love, context is life.

## Communication

- Email ‚úÖ - I usually check it twice a day (morning and afternoon) - note: I'm a zero inbox person, I will read or forward or automatically discard all of my emails.
- Slack ‚úÖ - Love them messages and huddles, I check it after every meeting and if I have none - every 2 hours, unless I'm in a deep work status.
- Phone (work) ‚úÖ - I reply if I am on-call or if it's an emergency, otherwise I will call you back when I'm available
- Phone (personal) ‚ùå - Quite difficult that I give away my personal number - sorry, I separate 99.999% (yes, those are three nines) work and personal life - In case you have my personal it means I'm fond of you so please don't call me for work-related stuff.
- Jira or similar tracking software üü° - I might be involved in 20+ tasks/topics/threads/streams/PRs at the same time... Please message me on Slack or send me an email if you need me to do or check something, a mention won't work to get my attention in a timely fashion and if it did in the past you were being lucky.

Sidenote: in the unfortunate case you use Teams I will _highly_ recommend you to switch to Slack instead, waaay better.

Mattermost is not bad either but it's still an extra software to install, Slack is standard c'mon.

## Hello

See: [No hello manifesto](https://nohello.net/en)

Examples:

"Hello Matteo, how are you? I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I have a question about our Kubernetes cluster. I'm trying to deploy a new API Gateway with our internal operator but I'm getting an error, find the logs attached. Can you help me?"

- Polite ‚úÖ
- Straight to the point ‚úÖ
- Context ‚úÖ

"There's something wrong with that new k8s operator, we need to fix it ASAP."

- Polite ‚úÖ - yep, I consider it polite even without an "hello", it's an emergency!
- Straight to the point ‚úÖ
- Context ‚úÖ

"Hello Matteo" and then disappearing until I reply

- Waste of time for the both of us ‚ùå

"Hey Matteo, just wanted to say hi, long time no chat huh? Did you move in the end?"
"Hello Matteo, have you watched the new episode of [insert TV series here]?"

- Non-work related üü° - I'll take my time to reply, thanks for messaging!

## Meetings

### All-hands / City Hall or whatever they call them these days

First of all, unless you are announcing IPO: üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©

If it's a 1-way broadcast it might as well be a video, right?

I'll be eternally grateful if you let me consume your message whenever I have time that day or the day after.

### 1:1

Love them regardless of being the manageR or the manageD.
Once a month works.

### Big Group Meetings

Unless necessary, I try to avoid group meetings. I prefer async communication, it's more efficient and it allows us to focus on getting the actual work done.

If you feel the need to involve me in a group meeting be sure to send me an agenda and set a clear expectation for my contribution.
I will join in time and I'll be super happy to help you!

Don't take it personal if I decline. Typical reasons are:
- Missing agenda, update it and send me a message about it.
- Conflicting meeting and yours was deemed to have a lesser priority/urgency, reschedule if you can.
- I don't know who you are / we don't work together so I assume you added me by mistake, shit happens!
- There are already people smarter than me that can serve my same purpose/role, sorry but I would be redundant and not helpful.
- It's out of my working hours, I usually start around 10 AM until 5:30 PM (time zone based)
- I'm off that day, 99% of the time I have set an Out of Office event but you probably didn't notice it.

Btw rule of thumb: if you can solve or decide about something without me, do it, I trust you. If I happen to be your lead/manager just send me a recap message afterwards.

### Working group / "War" room

Necessary evil, let's do it and get stuff done so we can get back on track and I can unpause Spotify.

### Random meetings

In case you just wanna chat about random stuff with me I would **love** to have a (virtual or real) coffee break together! ‚òï

## Deep Work

See: [Deep Work](files/deep-work.pdf)

## Bureaucracy

I hate bureaucracy. Strong word, I know but I really hate it with all my heart. I will do my very best to avoid it at all costs.

As you could've guessed, I don't cope well with it and it makes me feel like I'm wasting my and company time by not doing anything useful.

Avoid forcing me to do it if you can, I will be forever grateful and I will stay in your company for way longer.

## Feedback

### Receiving

I struggle with receiving positive feedback. I'm not used to it and I don't know how to react to it. I'm working on it.

I love constructive (negative) feedback, I'm always trying to improve myself and I'm happy to receive actionable feedback on how to do it. - 
e.g. "You should improve your content delivery" - not actionable; "You should improve your content delivery, by adding examples when you explain something technical, plus some sort of scheme and image" - perfect.

I will ask for a lot of advice rather than feedback, I'm more comfortable with that and I find that people naturally come up with something actionable when asked for advice.

### Giving

I think it's easy for me to be honest, I can sometime avoid telling you something to find the right time and place but if I ever gave you a feedback it rarely comes from an impulsive thought.
I constantly elaborate information and my brain hardly stops, so yeah, try to not take it personal and I'll do my best to not hurt your feelings.

Please tell me if I do.

E.g. if your code is being crappy lately I will just tell you "hey, this code is crap" - but I won't ever think or tell that **YOU** are. You didn't see my code from 2017. Thanks God.

## Mistakes

I won't blame anyone personally for making mistakes, unless it's myself. I make a lot of them, dang. 
I ask you tell me if I do something wrong and in return I will try to learn and make the most out your feedback. If we are not making mistakes we are not learning.

Note: If you try to gaslight me I will totally get mad.

p.s. If we have a good relationship I might make fun of you for making a mistake, but I will do it in a friendly way and expect you to do the same, I promise! ü§ù
