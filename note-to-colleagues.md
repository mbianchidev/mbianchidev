# 🤝 User Manual: How to Work With Me

> *Also valid for OSS contributors*

---

## 👋 Introduction

Heya there future (or current) colleague!

**Pronouns**: Please use he/him or they/them when referring to me, thanks!

### Setting Expectations

I have good intentions most of the time, but not all the times: I can definitely be pissed off.

Being a non-native English speaker I might still come across as dry or even rude, when I am actually in my usual state of grumpiness.

> **You must know** I am so sorry if something I said ended up hurting your feelings and please let me know if I do, I am always on my way to improve.

## 🧑 About Me

### Personality

<table>
<tr>
<td>🤗</td>
<td><b>Friendly & Helpful</b> - I love to help people and always strive to do so. Sometimes at my expense, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🔋</td>
<td><b>Introverted</b> - I might not be the most talkative person in the room nor I am energized by people, au contraire. Social moments drain my battery (but I still enjoy them!).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>❓</td>
<td><b>Curious</b> - I usually have a lot of questions and I'm not afraid to ask them (even if they might sound quite stupid).</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>

### Common Topics
Want to find some common topics to talk about? Check out my special interests: [here](extra.md)

### Values I Care About

- 🌱 **Climate Change** - I care about it and I'm trying to do my part to help the planet
- 🏳️‍🌈 **LGBTQ+ Ally** - I'm an ally and I'm trying to educate myself more on the topic
- ✊ **Social Issues** - I care deeply about social issues and human rights but I am not vocal about it on the job or in professional settings, mostly to avoid retaliation (we live in a sick society)

> **Important**: I don't want to talk politics or religion at work. I also do not want to know what you might think about those topics, it could hurt our professional relationship so please keep those thoughts for yourself.

## 🔊 Screaming

I can't stand people (regardless of their role in the company) screaming at other people. We are human beings, not machines. We have feelings and emotions.

I will **never** scream at you or anybody, so I expect the same from you if we are in the same team, even if you are my manager or in my chain (_we only have those to lose, bro_)

### If You're Angry
It's completely valid. ❤️ You need to:
1. Take a break
2. Go for a walk
3. Do something else
4. Then come back and we will talk about it

> **Btw** I can scream at a way higher volume than you and I have proof. 😉

---

## 🤚 Touching

I really don't like to be touched, unless I explicitly gave consent for it.

**My Preferences**:
- ❌ Not a hugger on the job unless we know each other really well
- ✅ Handshaker
- ✅ High-fiver
- ✅ Fist-bumper!

---

## 📋 Context

> Context is love, context is life.

| Scenario | What I Need |
|----------|-------------|
| 🤔 Asking me a question? | **Context.** |
| 💬 Giving me specific information? | **Context first!** |
| 📝 Asking me to do something? | **Context** (and your subjective urgency evaluation), please. |

## 💬 Communication Preferences

<table>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Details</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>📧 Email</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>I check it twice a day (morning and afternoon). I'm a zero inbox person - I will read, forward, reply or automatically discard all emails.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>💬 Chat</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Love quick huddles/calls. I check chat after every meeting and if I have none - about every 2 hours, unless I'm in deep work status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>📹 Videocall</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>Schedule a call, my calendar is probably open (busy means busy tho, and lunch is more than sacred)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>📞 Phone (company)</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>I reply if I am on-call or if it's an emergency, otherwise I will call you back when I'm available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>📱 Phone (personal)</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>Quite difficult that I give away my personal number - I separate 99.999% (yes, those are three nines) work and personal life. If you have it, don't call/text me for work-related stuff. I'd block you straight away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🎯 Tracking Software</td>
<td>🟡</td>
<td>I might be involved in 20+ tasks/topics/threads/streams/PRs at the same time... Please message me on Slack or send me an email if you need me to do or check something, a mention won't work to get my attention in a timely fashion!</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 💡 Tool Recommendations
- **Microsoft Teams** → I will _highly_ recommend you to switch to Slack instead, way better
- **Mattermost** → Not bad either but it's still an extra software to install, Slack is standard c'mon

## 🚫 Don't Just Say Hello

> See: [No Hello Manifesto](https://nohello.net/en)

### ✅ Good Examples

<details>
<summary><b>Example 1: Detailed and Polite</b></summary>
<br>

"Hello Matteo, how are you? I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I have a question about our Kubernetes cluster. I'm trying to deploy a new API Gateway with our internal operator but I'm getting an error, find the logs attached. Can you help?"

- ✅ Polite
- ✅ Straight to the point
- ✅ Context

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Example 2: Emergency (No fluff needed)</b></summary>
<br>

"There's something wrong with that new k8s operator, we need to fix it ASAP."

- ✅ Polite (yep, I consider it polite even without an "hello", especially if it's an emergency!)
- ✅ Straight to the point
- ✅ Context

</details>

### ❌ Bad Examples

| Example | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| "Hello Matteo" _and then disappearing until I reply._ | ❌ Waste of time for both of us |

### 🟡 Non-Work Related (I'll take my time to reply)

| Example |
|---------|
| "Hey Matteo, just wanted to say hi, long time no chat huh? Did you move in the end?" |
| "Hello Matteo, have you watched the new episode of [insert TV series here]?" |

---

## 📅 Calendar Management

> I work with my calendar only. I have events for EVERYTHING (work related and not).

### 🟢 You Can Try to Book Me
- "Work on x"
- "Read x"
- Any event with just me in it

### 🔴 Don't Book Me On
- **Out of Office** means out of office
- **Lunch** means lunch
- **Any meal blocks** - PLEASE do not book me on my meal block unless you like rejection, lol

> **Meals are important to me. Respect the meal blocks!**

## 💭 Feedback

### 📥 Receiving Feedback

**Positive Feedback**
- I struggle with receiving it
- Not used to it and don't really know how to react
- Working on it!

**Constructive (Negative) Feedback**
- I love it!
- Always trying to improve myself
- Happy to receive actionable feedback

<table>
<tr>
<th>Not Actionable</th>
<th>Perfect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>❌ "You should improve your content delivery"</td>
<td>✅ "You should improve your content delivery, by adding examples when you explain something technical, plus some sort of scheme and image"</td>
</tr>
</table>

**I Prefer Advice Over Feedback**
- More comfortable asking for advice
- People naturally come up with something actionable when asked for advice

### 📤 Giving Feedback

I think it's easy for me to be honest. I can sometimes avoid telling you something to find the right time and place but if I ever gave you feedback it rarely comes from an impulsive thought.

I constantly elaborate information and my brain hardly stops, so yeah, try to not take it personal and I'll do my best to not hurt your feelings.

> **Again, please tell me if I do.**

#### Code vs Person
If your code is being crappy lately I will just tell you "hey, this code is crap" - but I won't ever think or tell that **YOU** are.

Also, you didn't see my code from 2015. Thanks God. 😅

---

## 🔧 Mistakes

I won't blame anyone personally for making mistakes, unless it's myself. I make a lot of them, dang.

I ask you tell me if I do something wrong and in return I will try to learn and make the most out your feedback. If we are not making mistakes we are not learning.

> **Note**: If you try to gaslight me I will absolutely be mad.

**p.s.** If we have a good relationship I might make fun of you for making a mistake, but I will do it in a friendly way and expect you to do the same, I promise! 🤝

---

## 💼 Beliefs & Work Philosophy

> The following stuff is not actionable from you, dear colleague, it's just who I am.

---

### 🔄 Scrum Sucks

Yeah, it really does. Why? Read [this](https://blog.mb-consulting.dev/scrum-sucks-9960011fc5cf).

---

### 📅 Meetings

#### General Meeting Guidelines

If you feel the need to involve me in a meeting be sure to:
- 📋 Send me an agenda
- 🎯 Set a clear expectation for my contribution

Most of the times meetings can be async or a shared doc where we brainstorm, hence I try to avoid meetings unless it's necessary. I highly prefer async communication, it's more efficient and it allows us to focus on getting the actual work done.

#### Scheduling Preferences

I will really be fond of you in case you will choose to:
- ⏰ Schedule any kind of meeting **at least 24 hours in advance**
- 🌍 Schedule according to my time zone

If you need to reschedule, no big deal, just let me know with a quick message but it doesn't have to become the norm or I won't accept any further meeting invite.

---

### 🔁 Recurring Meetings

I find them useful to:
- Catch up
- Have a quick overview
- Update any kind of status
- Finalize some items

**They need an agenda.**

If you need to loosen the schedule of recurring meetings I'm 100% with you, just ask/tell me instead of pushing them of 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week multiple times. Shuffling that much hurts my trust in you.

---

### 🏢 All-Hands / City Hall

> *Or whatever they call them these days*

Unless you are announcing IPO: 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

If it's a 1-way broadcast with no interaction, it might as well be a video, right?

**I'll be eternally grateful** if you let me consume your video message whenever I have time that day or the day after.

---

### 👥 1:1 Meetings

Love them regardless of being the manageR or the manageD.

**Ideal frequency**: Once a month or every two weeks works best imho, unless one of us is currently onboarding.

---

### 👥👥👥 Big Group Meetings

I will join in time and I'll be super happy to say hi to the team but...

**Nothing personal if I decline.**

#### Typical Reasons for Declining:

<table>
<tr>
<td>📋</td>
<td>Missing agenda (there should always be one, possibly tagging people where they are needed)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>⏰</td>
<td>Conflicting meeting and yours was deemed to have a lesser priority/urgency by me (or most probably my direct manager), reschedule if you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>❓</td>
<td>I don't know who you are / we don't work together so I assume you added me by mistake, shit happens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>👥</td>
<td>There are already people possibly even smarter than me that can serve my same purpose/role, sorry but I would be redundant or not necessary at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🕐</td>
<td>It's out of my working hours, I usually start around 10 AM until 5:30 PM (time zone based)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🏖️</td>
<td>I'm off that day, 99% of the time I have set an Out of Office event but you probably didn't notice it.</td>
</tr>
</table>

> **Rule of thumb**: If you can solve or decide about something without me, do it, I trust you. If I happen to be your lead/manager just send me a recap message afterwards.

### ⚔️ Working Group / "War" Room

Necessary evil, let's do it and get stuff done so we can get back on track and I can unpause Spotify.

---

### ☕ Random Meetings

In case you just wanna chat about random stuff with me I would **love** to have a (virtual or real) coffee break together! ☕

Just let me know a bit in advance.

### 📝 Bureaucracy

I hate bureaucracy. Strong word, I know but I really hate it with all my heart. I will do my very best to avoid it at all costs.

As you could've guessed, I don't cope well with it and it makes me feel like I'm wasting my and company time by not doing anything useful.

**Avoid forcing me to do it if you can**, I will be forever grateful and I will stay in your company for way longer.
