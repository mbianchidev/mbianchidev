# Note to recruiters and companies

I consider myself a mix between a **Software Engineer**, **Platform Engineer** (with DevOps and SRE background), a **Developer Relations Engineer** with a pinch of leadership in me - for sure more than management - and a love for both Product and Customer-related roles.

I'm a Kubernetes & cloud expert, a DevOps coach, an experienced coder in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, Golang, TypeScript...), a mentor, an international speaker, a tech writer, a community leader... ADHD anyone?

As neuro-divergent individual I think and operate differently from the majority but I think it is my strenght and I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo.

I don't really like resumes but I have a public one, ask me for it if you need it.

## Companies I work with MUST... 

- Not be operating, collaborating closely with companies in the following domains:
  - Military / Weaponry
  - Gambling / Online-Casino
  - Shitcoin (crypto scams) / NFTs (unless smart contracts)
  - Oil & Gas
  - Governments that are not on my allowlist (or have ties with them) 
- Be a body shop consultancy firm, for me this is a **big NO NO**, I'm not a commodity and you're not going to make any margin over my hard work - I can support customers myself via freelancing.
- Allow to operate remote in a flexible way, including working from abroad.
- Have a moonlight policy that allows me to:
  - Coach/mentor people 1:1 (off hours)
  - Contribute to OSS without needing to ask for permission
  - Advisory work in respect of a non-compete agreement (off hours)
- Allow me to organize (off hours) - and go (office hours) - to tech events
- Allow me to speak at tech events (office hours) and if looking for affiliation fully cover my travel, accomodation and food expenses - seems obvious but in my experience it is not.

## I would love to work for a company that...

- Operates in the following fields in order of preference:
  - DevTools
  - Green/Blue Energy (susteinability in general is fine)
  - ML/AI
  - Cloud Native tech (Monitoring, Observablity, Security, CI/CD, etc.)
- Is a startup/scaleup (Series A+), therefore has low bureaucracy and being able to move fast!
- Advocates for full-remote, work for anywhere work - async-first - so I can work for 3 months from Bali, Indonesia or wherever I want - note:  I will happily swing by the office for social events if I feel like it and I think company offsites are ok (full expenses covered and possibly not in the weekend as I typically have other plans)
-  A moonlight policy that allows me to also:
   - Have my own side projects generating revenues (non-competing) - e.g. publishing a fitness app on the Android app store
- Overall flexibility, here's some examples of what I mean:
  - I don't necessarily dig waking up at 9 AM every day for a standup meeting - that could be done async or even avoided most times - read [here](https://blog.mb-consulting.dev/scrum-sucks-9960011fc5cf) for my take on Agile Scrum btw.
  - I don't like to be forced to a boring 9-5, I prefer to work per objectives/goals when I'm in my best shape and I cannot do that if my laundry is not done! _On a serious note, I never had issues with delivering results in my career, I'm a responsible and reliable person._
- Sponsor events that I organize

**TLDR; just be a nice company to me and I will be a very nice employee/freelancer to you.**

## Most importantly...

My physical and mental health has 100% priority over everything else, my family has a higher priority than **any** job. 

I'm not going to compromise on this and neither should anyone else!

## Specific to companies in search of a freelancer

I'm always looking for new challenges, so if you're looking for a Cloud Native Consultant, feel free to reach out to me.

My starting hourly rate as a freelancer is **125‚Ç¨/hour** - slightly negotiable.

My daily rate is 8*hourly rate, _duh_.

I discounts my freelancer rate if: 
  - you are a non-for profit organization;
  - I'm doing meaningful work - e.g. sustainability, children education...
  - you are a pre-seed/seed startup, I really dig the idea, plus your founder(s) and if you offer me some equities. _Series A+ gets the full price, sorry._

I'm open to full-time with some flexibility and limitations to be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

## Specific to recruiters or companies in search of an employee

While I could not be actively looking for a job, I'm always open to new opportunities.

To have an idea of my salary expectations for a full-time position, as of 2024, is:
- starting from **130k base EUR/year (EMEA)** + bonus + equity + perks
- starting from **160k base USD/year (US)** + bonus + equity + perks (sponsorship needed - O-1 possible)

I'm open for relocation, but not in every area.

Just know that for salary offers I will always check with my wide network, levels.fyi and Glassdoor to make sure you're not lowballing.

_Just be ware that I know my market worth and how much your company typically pays for the role I'm applying for._

## My view on interviews

Addressing the elephant in the room: coding riddles, leetcoding, whiteboard interviews, etc. 

üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©

In hope to avoid getting these I created [this repo](https://github.com/mbianchidev/engineering-interviews) to collect coding challenges and interview material. 

My success rate at the technical interview stages has been around 67.9% out of 100+ in the past 9 years, so I'm not afraid of coding interviews. I just don't like to waste time with self-contained riddles that a new grad could solve by just memorizing algorithms and data structures 101 or leetcoding all day for 2 weeks. 

_Reversing a binary tree? Been there, done that, please be smarter and ask something meaningful._

Btw I also have some open-source code on my GitHub profile, so you can check that out if you really want to see how I code, right? üòâ

Here's an example of why I don't like these kind of interviews:

- Me: "So, this is a coding interview for a Staff SRE role, right? Will I ever write any code even remotely looking like the one I'm asked to solve right now?"
- Interviewer: "No, you are right but this is the process, we just have to execute..."
- Me: "Okay, thanks a lot for your time, bye!"

About the numbers of interviews: I do sparring interviews once every _some_-months, just to keep up with the market and understand if my market value has increased or not.

That said, if you have a fair career development plan in place (with salary evaluation included) and a good internal mobility in your company, you have nothing to worry about. Literally.
