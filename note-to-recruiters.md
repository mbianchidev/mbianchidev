# 💼 Note to Recruiters & Companies

---

## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I consider myself a mix between:
- **Software Engineer**
- **Platform Engineer** (with DevOps and SRE background)
- **Developer Relations Engineer**
- A pinch of **leadership** (more than management)
- A love for both **Product** and **Customer-related** roles

### Technical Expertise
- 🐳 Kubernetes & cloud expert
- 🔄 DevOps coach
- 💻 Experienced coder in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, Golang, TypeScript...)
- 🎓 Mentor
- 🎤 International keynote speaker
- ✍️ Tech writer
- 🌐 Community leader

> As a neuro-spicy individual I think and operate differently from the majority but I think it is my strength and I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo.

*I don't really like resumes but I have a public one, ask me for it if you need it.*

## ✅ Companies I Work With MUST...

> Essential requirements

### 🌍 Remote & Flexibility
- Allow to operate remote in a flexible way, including working from abroad

### 🌙 Moonlight Policy
Must allow me to:
- Coach/mentor people 1:1 (off hours)
- Contribute to OSS without needing to ask for permission
- Advisory work in respect of a non-compete agreement (off hours)

### 🎤 Speaking & Events
- Allow me to organize (off hours) - and go (office hours) - to tech events
- Allow me to speak at tech events (office hours) and if looking for affiliation fully cover my travel, accommodation and food expenses - seems obvious but in my experience it is not

## 💚 I Would Love to Work for a Company That...

> My ideal workplace characteristics

### 🎯 Preferred Industries
*(In order of preference)*
1. DevTools
2. Green/Blue Energy (sustainability in general is fine)
3. ML/AI
4. Cloud Native tech (Monitoring, Observability, Security, CI/CD, etc.)

### 🚀 Company Stage
- Startup/scaleup (Series A+)
- Low bureaucracy
- Ability to move fast!

### 🌐 Work Style
- **Full-remote advocate** - work from anywhere
- **Async-first** - so I can work for 3 months from Bali, Indonesia or wherever I want
- Note: I will happily swing by the office for social events if I feel like it
- Company offsites are ok (full expenses covered and possibly not in the weekend as I typically have other plans)

### 🌙 Enhanced Moonlight Policy
Allows me to also:
- Have my own side projects generating revenues (non-competing) - e.g. publishing a fitness app on the Android app store

### 🎨 Overall Flexibility
Examples of what I mean:
- **Async Standups** - I don't necessarily dig waking up at 9 AM every day for a standup meeting - that could be done async or even avoided most times - read [here](https://blog.mb-consulting.dev/scrum-sucks-9960011fc5cf) for my take on Agile Scrum btw.
- **Results-Oriented** - I don't like to be forced to a boring 9-5, I prefer to work per objectives/goals when I'm in my best shape and I cannot do that if my laundry is not done! 
  - *On a serious note, I never had issues with delivering results in my career, I'm a responsible and reliable person.*

### 🎪 Event Sponsorship
- Sponsor events that I organize

> **TLDR; just be a nice company to me and I will be a very nice employee/freelancer to you.**

---

## ⚠️ Most Importantly...

> My non-negotiable priorities

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">❤️</td>
<td><b>Physical and mental health has 100% priority over everything else</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</td>
<td><b>My family has a higher priority than ANY job</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

**I'm not going to compromise on this and neither should anyone else!**

## 🎯 My View on Interviews

> Let's address the elephant in the room

### 🚩 What I DON'T Like

**Coding riddles, leetcoding, whiteboard interviews, etc.**

🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

In hope to avoid getting these I created [this repo](https://github.com/mbianchidev/engineering-interviews) to collect coding challenges and interview material.

### 📊 My Interview Stats
- **Success rate**: ~67.9% out of 100+ technical interviews in the past 10+ years
- I'm not afraid of coding interviews
- I just don't like wasting time with self-contained riddles that a new grad could solve by just memorizing algorithms and data structures 101 or leetcoding all day for 2 weeks

> *Reversing a binary tree? Been there, done that, please be smarter and ask something meaningful.*

### 💡 Alternative Approach
I have some open source code on my GitHub profile, so you can check that out if you really want to see how I code, right? 😉

### 🎭 Real Example

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see why I decline certain interviews</b></summary>
<br>

**Me**: "So, this is a coding interview for a Staff SRE role, right? Will I ever write any code even remotely looking like the one I'm asked to solve right now?"

**Interviewer**: "No, you are right but this is the process, we just have to execute..."

**Me**: "Okay, thanks a lot for your time, bye!"

</details>

### 🎯 About Interview Numbers
I do sparring interviews once every _some_-months, just to keep up with the market and understand if my market value has increased or not.

> **That said**, if you have a fair career development plan in place (with salary evaluation included) and a good internal mobility in your company, you have nothing to worry about. Literally.
