#### Note to recruiters and companies

I consider myself a mix between a **Software Engineer**, **Platform Engineer** (with DevOps and SRE background), a **Developer Relations Engineer** with a pinch of leadership in me - for sure more than management - 

I'm a cloud expert, a DevOps coach, an experienced coder in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, Golang, TypeScript...), a mentor, an international speaker, a tech writer, a community leader... ADHD anyone?

As neuro-divergent individual I think and operate differently from the majority but I think it is my strenght and I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo.

I don't like resumes but I have a public one, ask me for it if you need it.

Regardless of freelancing or employment, from companies I work with I expect the following...

##### Must 

- Not operating in the following fields:
  - Military / Weaponry
  - Gambling / Online-Casino
  - Shitcoin (crypto scams) / NFTs (unless smart contracts)
  - Oil & Gas
  - Governments that are not on my allowlist (or have ties with them) 
- Body Rental consultancy is a **big NO NO** for me, I'm not a commodity and you're not going to make money over my head.
- Allowing full-remote, even better being remote-first or mostly async - if you have an office I will happily come by for social events if I feel like it.
- A moonlight policy that allows me to
  - Coach/mentor people 1:1 (off hours)
  - Organize (off hours) - and go (mostly during work hours) - to tech events 
  - Contribute to OSS without needing to ask anyone's permission
- Fully cover my travel, accomodation and food expenses if I'm ever required to travel as part of the job - seems obvious but in my experience it is not.

##### Nice to have

- Operating in the following fields in order of preference:
  - DevTools
  - Green/Blue Energy (susteinability in general is fine)
  - ML/AI
  - Cloud Native tech (Monitoring, Observablity, Security, CI/CD, etc.)
- Being a startup/scaleup, therefore having low bureaucracy and being able to move fast!
- Work from anywhere so I can work for 1 month from Bali, Indonesia 🤩
-  A moonlight policy that allows me to also:
   - Advise startups (non-competing)
   - Have my own side projects generating revenues (non-competing) - e.g. writing a book, publishing a fitness app on the app store
- Overall flexibility, here's some examples of what I mean:
  - I don't necessarily dig waking up at 9 AM every day for a standup meeting - that could be done async or not at all.
  - I don't like to be forced to a boring 9-5, I prefer to work per objectives/goals when I'm in my best shape and I cannot do it if my laundry is not done! On a serious note, I never had issues with delivering results in my career, they say I'm a responsible and reliable person.
  - I like going to and organizing conferences, meetups and events. I want to be able to do that without having to take PTOs, I'm ok with booth duties ofc.


**TLDR; just be a nice company and I will be a nice employee/freelancer for you.**


My physical and mental health has 100% priority over everything else, my family is a priority. 

I'm not going to compromise and neither should anyone else!

#### Specific to companies in search of a freelancer

I'm always looking for new challenges, so if you're looking for a Cloud Native Consultant, feel free to reach out to me.
My starting hourly rate as a freelancer is 125€/hour.
My daily rate as a freelancer is 1000€/day - 8 hours/day.

Discounts to my freelancer rate are limited to: 
  - education - I really enjoy teaching;
  - non-for profit orgs;
  - meaningful work - e.g. sustainability, security...
  - pre-seed/seed startups - only when initial funding is low or none and I really dig the idea, plus the founder(s). Series A+ get the full price, sorry.

I usually prefer to work per-objectives but I'm also open to full-time with some flexibility and limitations to be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 

#### Specific to recruiters or companies in search of an employee

I am actively looking for a job, open to new opportunities.

To have an idea of my salary expectations for a full-time position, as of 2024, is:
- minimum 120k base €/year (EU) + bonus + equity + perks
- minimum 150k base $/year (US) + bonus + equity + perks (sponsorship needed)

I'm open for relocation but not in every area.

Just know that for salary offers I will check my wide network, levels.fyi and Glassdoor to make sure you're not lowballing me.
I typically know my market worth and how much your company pays.

Addressing the elephant in the room: coding riddles, leetcoding, whiteboard interviews, etc. 

🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

In hope to avoid getting these I created [this repo](https://github.com/mbianchidev/coding-challenges) to collect all the bs coding riddles I got asked. 

My success rate at the technical interview stages has been around 79.8% out of 100+ in the past 9 years, so I'm not afraid of coding interviews. I just don't like to waste time with self-contained riddles that a new grad could solve by just memorizing algorithms and data structures 101. Reversing a binary tree? Been there, done that, please be smarter and ask something meaningful.

You know what also bogs me? That more often than not these coding interviews have nothing to do with the job I'm applying for... lol.

Me: "So, this is a coding interview for a Staff SRE role, right? Will I ever write any code even remotely looking like the one I'm asked to solve right now?"
Interviewer: "No, you are right but this is the process, we just have to execute..."
Me: "Okay, thanks a lot for your time, bye!"

Btw I also have some open-source code on my GitHub profile, so you can check that out if you really want to see how I code, right? 😉

One last thing, about the concerning numbers of interviews: yes, I do sparring interviews once every some-months, just to keep up with the market and understand if I can get a better job than my current one.

If you have a fair development plan in place (salary evaluation included) you have nothing to worry about. Literally.

Cookies and a big high five for reading this far 🍪🍪🍪
