## Description / Abstract

In the world of data on Kubernetes and cloud-native development, managing databases at scale while ensuring reliability and resilience is quite a challenge. With platform engineering, organizations are adopting a unified approach to deliver scalable and self-service infrastructure to developers.
Where does your data fit into this new paradigm?

Enter CloudNativePG, the open-source Kubernetes operator for PostgreSQL. In this talk, we'll explore how CloudNativePG enables teams to manage PostgreSQL databases in a Kubernetes-native way, aligning with platform engineering principles to deliver automated, reliable, and developer-friendly database services.

From provisioning to failover, backups to scaling, we'll demonstrate how CloudNativePG simplifies data management and gives platform engineers the observability, control, and automation they need, including day-2.

## Benefits for the Ecosystem
Get familiar with CloudNativePG and how to deploy databases in Kubernetes.

Learn how to turn "Houston, we have a problem" into "Houston, our platform is ready," and ensure your data strategy survives and thrives in the era of platform engineering and Kubernetes

We'll also address how does this approach can impact data residency, security, and compliance in multi-cloud and hybrid environment.
