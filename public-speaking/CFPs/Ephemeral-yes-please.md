## Description / Abstract

**OSS Project used**: GitHub, Flux, Kubernetes

We are building platforms to enable developers and golden path, we are delivering faster in production and we are doing it with golden paths in mind. 
We are using Kubernetes, GitOps, maybe even an IDP but what about test environments?

Often forgotten during the software development lifecycle, rapid and reliable testing environments are much needed to ensure product quality. 
Traditional testing environments can fall short in scalability or be a complete waste of resource and it will inevitably lead to bottlenecks in the development pipeline. 
This session aim is to showcase through a live demo our choosen approach to spawn on-demand ephemeral environments triggered by pull requests, leveraging the power of Flux and GitHub actions.

## Benefits

Attendees will understand how Flux, a GitOps tool, can seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of transient environments, by creating (and updating) isolated and reproducible testing grounds for each PR, in their infrastructure of choice.
Development teams can ensure comprehensive validation of changes before merging, significantly reducing the risk of defective deployments in production.
