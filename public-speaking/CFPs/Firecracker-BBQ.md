## Description / Abstract

Ever wandered what Firecracker VMs have in common with your barbecue?!

Join me for a smokey session where we'll fire up the grill and cook up some juicy and medium-rare knowledge about Firecracker VMs.
We will break down the world of microVMs into micro knowledge bites (pun intended), then we will see how cloud workloads are cooked to perfection by our favorite chef, Firecracker, in a quick and spicy demo.

Whether you're a cloud engineer, a developer familiar with DevOps, or simply a tech enthusiast with an appetite for knowledge, this talk will leave you with a full plate of insights on how Firecracker is revolutionizing lightweight virtualization. Grab your forks and get ready to feast on some nice and tender Firecracker VMs!
