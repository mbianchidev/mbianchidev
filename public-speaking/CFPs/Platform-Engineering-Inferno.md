## Description / Abstract

Imagine yourself as Dante, lost in a Deep Dark Forest.

You are not alone, I will be your Virgil, your guide through the Engineering Hell.
This Platform Engineering dream can, and will, be turned into a nightmare if tools and practices are adopted without a rationale and no focus on culture.
Following an oneiric path, inspired by the Divine Comedy, we will travel through each Hell ring, examining all the different ways to fall into the flame pit of Engineering Hell, all the demons you can encounter on the way to reach the peaks of your well deserved Platform Engineering Eden.
