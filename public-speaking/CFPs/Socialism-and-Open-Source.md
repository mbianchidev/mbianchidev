## Description / Abstract

Exploring the not-so-obvious intersection between socialism and open source software might sound scary at first, but what if by examining Socialism values proves to be an interesting exercise?
See how equality, collaboration, and community can shape the future of both digital innovation and social progress; by drawing parallels between socialist principles and the open source model, we will discuss how these projects foster a more equal distribution of resources, knowledge, and opportunity.

Open source software provides a platform for inclusivity, offering individuals from any backgrounds access to all the tools, resources, and potentially income that might otherwise be reserved for the elite. 
We will explore how open source communities are not just about code but are also spaces for social justice, where anyone, regardless of their status can contribute, learn, and thrive.

Open source projects can serve as means to challenge traditional capitalist and profit-oriented structures, promoting equality by redistributing power and wealth within the tech landscape. 
We will also look at how open source initiatives can provide alternative career paths, support marginalized communities, and create new forms of collective ownership and social mobility.

Join as we discuss how the principles of socialism can inspire and redefine open source communities, turning them into powerful vehicles for both social change and more sustainable income generation.

This is an outline of the talk:

- What is socialism (and why it's not scary at all)
- How socialism applies to Open Source
- How open source is a platform for inclusivity
- What can trigger the change in the economic paradigm
- Opportunities to make the (open source) world a (slightly) better place
