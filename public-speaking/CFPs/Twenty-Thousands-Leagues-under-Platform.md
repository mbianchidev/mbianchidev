## Description / Abstract

A 3-year long story about getting an enterprise from "zero to hero" from manually deploying monoliths, to CI/CD, microservices, Gitops and building an IDP in 2020, before DevEx was cool.

This talk is a behind-the-scenes of an adventurous journey within a medium-sized enterprise, navigating through challenges and obstacles of going Cloud Native with a blend of diplomacy, acknowledging the complexity of convincing management, developers and stakeholders while leveraging various open-source tools to get from on-premise all-manual development to cloud automation and beyond.

Lifting a monolith, re-architecting apps to microservices, deploying to K8s, implementing helm, then all the way to integrating different pipelines with ArgoCD, FluxCD and JenkinsX without forgetting observability.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

For this talk I invite the audience to extract valuable lessons that can be applied to their own challenges to build a Platform tailored to their needs.

Not focusing on just tools but processes and getting internal traction above all.

How Platform transformation can bring value even to the most resistant enterprise, the impact of changing team topology, understanding the trade-off between different tools, migrating from on-premise to the cloud, balancing composability and standardization and winning the resistance to change by questioning the status quo.

All of this to build a Platform, not because it is cool, but because of the real need of streamlining operations and avoiding tool sprawling when dealing with complex services/products and multiple teams.
