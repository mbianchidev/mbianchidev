## Description / Abstract

**OSS Project used**: Kubernetes, Prow

In this talk, I’ll explore how the Kubernetes Communications Team serves as the vital link between the technical contributors driving Kubernetes innovation and the global community relying on it.

You’ll learn how we:
- Coordinate across SIGs (Special Interest Groups) to capture and clarify key updates, to review changes and ensure the quality of the information provided is the highest possible.
- Translate technical release notes and KEPs into actionable insights for end users in the form of release blogs.
- Leverage tools and strategies to keep communication seamless, even in one of the most fast-paced open source projects in the world.

Whether you’re planning to contribute to Kubernetes, navigating its releases or maintaining any open source project, this session will provide insights into how open source communication practices can amplify collaboration, transparency, and serve your users.

Join me to understand how communication drives the Kubernetes evolution!

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

This session comes from my experience as Kubernetes Release Team member in the role of Communications Lead for Kubernetes v1.31.

I think this session could be interesting for attendees to:
1. Make people interested in contributing to Kubernetes and open the possibility for anyone to start with non-coding contributions;
2. Give ideas on how to structure an efficient communication process to open source maintainers, but also to product companies;
3. Give insights about the Kubernetes release process to k8s end users that might never have heard how this works;
