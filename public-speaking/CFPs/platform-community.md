## Description / Abstract

Platform engineering goes beyond building internal tools—it’s about creating a culture that inspires collaboration, excitement, and a sense of ownership. This panel will explore how fostering these elements across teams accelerates platform adoption and drives impactful outcomes like innovation, stability, and long-term growth.
Panelists will share real-world strategies for engaging engineers, gathering actionable feedback, and building alignment between platform teams and users. Whether you are starting fresh or scaling an established platform, join us to discover how community-driven enthusiasm can break down silos, spark advocacy, and create platforms that truly deliver value.

Key discussion points, useful for the ecosystem, include:
- Create environments where engineers feel empowered to contribute without fear of failure.
- Showcase quick wins and impact stories to build excitement and encourage more participation.
- Ensure platforms naturally integrate into engineers’ routines to reduce friction and boost adoption.
- Encourage experimentation by giving teams the freedom to extend and enhance the platform’s capabilities.
