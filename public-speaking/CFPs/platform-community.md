## Description / Abstract

As platform engineering continues to shape software development and the cloud native space, the importance of creating and fostering a vibrant community around platforms is becoming more and more important. 
Beyond technical excellence, successful platforms thrive through user engagement, collaboration, and community-driven innovation. 
This panel brings together community leaders and platform experts to discuss the vital role of community-building in platform success, focusing on real world examples of Platform built by and around communities. We'll focus on actionable steps to cultivate meaningful community involvement and explore key considerations for those aiming to build a platform with developers at its core.

Key discussion points include:

- Defining the roles and responsibilities in community-led platform development
- Navigating the balance between top-down platform governance and organic community contributions
- Long-term strategies for scaling community involvement and maintaining engagement, or the Platform Market Fit
- The impact of community feedback on shaping platform features and best practices
