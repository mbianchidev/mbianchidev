## Intro

Hi there!

I'm happy that you're interested in having me speak at your event. 
I truly love open source, technology and communities and I'm always excited to have another opportunity to share a time and space to exchange ideas with others.

I have some requirements and standards for accepting a speaking slot, submitting to a CFP, or engaging in any promotion of your event (yes, including reshares on X or LinkedIn).

### Bio and Headshot

You can find my bio [here](/public-speaking/home.md).

You can find pictures of me to use for your event, [here](/images/).

### Code of Conduct

Your event must have an explicitly-defined, enforced Code of Conduct linked publicly on your event's website, preferably as a top-level menu item. It should include a clear, readable description of what behavior is and is not acceptable, as well as at least one way for someone to report a violation, preferably not only to the organizers (external committee ftw). 
A paragraph of legalese buried in the Terms of Use is not sufficient to meet this requirement. If you're looking for inspiration, the [Anarchist Code of Conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20240417125638/https://anarchistcode.com/anarchist-code-of-conduct/view.php) is a great place to start.

### Speaker Diversity

Across your entire event, there must be adequate representation of expressions. The exact requirements is not written in stone, especially for smaller events, but generally, at least 20% of your total speaker lineup should be people who are diverse. By diverse I don't mean as most people do "not cisgender white males", but rather a mix of people from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This should definitely include queer people, neuro-diverse people, people with disabilities, people from different countries than the hosting one and people from different industries or from academia as well as not cisgender white males (I'm not one btw).

I believe underrepresented groups should be given some form of priority in the selection process but without lowering the bar for quality. 
I'm an organizer myself and I know how hard it is to find diverse speakers, on the other hand I don't believe in tokenism, so you shouldn't be forced to accept a bad talk just because it's from an underrepresented group.

p.s. Accepting a bad talk only because "duh, diversity" is equally bad, there are PLENTY of skilled and diverse speakers out there, I can help you find them!

### Costs for Speakers

No part of the cost of speaking at your event should lie with the speaker. 
My employer will typically cover airfare and accomodation for an event.
In the rare case the conference theme or attendee demographic does not aligns with my company goals, so they wouldn't sponsor my participation, I will ask you to do so. 
Regardless of whether or not my employer covers the cost of my appearance at your event, you must provide me with a full pass for the event.

If your event is a significant time zone change from me (Central European Time, UTC+2), I do ask that my arrival flight be booked to arrive a day or two before my speaking slot and maybe even after speaking, I like to explore!

In any case you will need to cover only conference-related expenses, I will cover all other costs for my extra stay.

### Fees

Since speaking at events is typically part of my job or I very much enjoy it, I do not generally require a speaking fee.

Unless it's a large-scale, corporate event where the organizing company stands to make a profit (AWS Re:Invent anyone?), or private internal corporate events: in both of these cases, my fee is negotiable based on the size of the event and whether or not I am a keynote speaker.

If you reimburse me for whatever, I will be happy and most likely donate it to a charity, so please let me know if you want me to donate it to a specific one.

### Intellectual Property

You may record or stream my event, but I retain ownership over the content of the talk and the right to give the talk at other events at my discretion. Recordings cannot be paywalled (unless I give express, written permission, such as if you have paid me for a private corporate event or we have an agreement where I have at least 50% of the revenues reverted to me as royalties).

I reserve the right to ask that any recording, audio or video, as well as my likeness, be taken down at any point in the future for any reason of my choosing.

### Cancellations

Cancelling a speaking engagement is something I try very, very hard to avoid. It never happened to me before. In case it happens, I will make my best effort to offer a remote or pre-recorded presentation. 

### Contacting Me

Reach out to me via [email](mailto:matteo@mb-consulting.ev) with the name, dates, and website for your event, as well as any confirmed speakers and an idea of what you want me to talk about. If your event fits into the corporate events category, please also include your speaker budget.

Thanks for reading!
