## Intro

Hi there!

I'm happy that you're interested in having me speak at your tech event. 
I truly love open source, technology and the related communities so I'm always excited to have another opportunity to share a time and space to exchange ideas with others.
I also love food from different cuisines so it's a win win!

However, I must say I have some requirements and standards for accepting a speaking slot, submitting to a CFP, or engaging in any promotion of your event (yes, including reshares on BlueSky or LinkedIn).

### Bio and Headshot

You can find my bio [here](/public-speaking/home.md).

You can find pictures of me to use for your event, [here](/images/).

### Non-discrimination

If you want me to attend or speak, in no way your event should discriminate attendees, speakers and staff based on:

- etnicity
- sex
- gender
- political opinions (banning fascists or any extreme right wing folks it is totally fair, tho. Avoid the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance))
- religion
- belief
- disability or chronic illness
- civil status
- age
- nationality
- education status
- job title

### Code of Conduct

Your event must have an explicitly-defined, enforced Code of Conduct linked publicly on your event's website, preferably as a top-level menu item. It should include a clear, readable description of what behavior is and is not acceptable, as well as at least one way for someone to report a violation, preferably not only to the organizers (external committee ftw). 
A paragraph of legalese buried in the Terms of Use is not sufficient to meet this requirement. If you're looking for inspiration, the [Anarchist Code of Conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20240417125638/https://anarchistcode.com/anarchist-code-of-conduct/view.php) is a great place to start.

### Speaker Diversity

Across your entire event, there must be adequate representation of expressions. The exact requirement is not written in stone, especially for smaller events I don't have a precise number in mind, but generally, at least 50% of your total speaker lineup should be people who are diverse. 

By diverse I don't mean as most people do just "not cisgender white males" as some folks, but I would rather see a mix of people from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This should definitely include non-males, non-white, queer people, neuro-diverse people, people with disabilities, people from different countries than the hosting one and people from different industries or from academia... It's also nice to have a mix of vendors, service providers and end-user companies represented.

I believe underrepresented groups should be given some form of priority in the selection process but without lowering the quality bar. 
I'm an organizer myself and I know how hard it can be to find diverse speakers if you don't know where to look.
On the other hand I don't believe in tokenism, so you shouldn't be forced to accept a bad talk just because it's from a speaker belonging to an underrepresented group.

p.s. There are PLENTY of skilled and diverse speakers out there, I can help you find and connect with them!

### Costs for Speakers

No part of the cost of speaking at your event should lie with speakers. 
My employer will typically cover airfare and accomodation for an event if it's deemed to be strategic for their business.
In case the conference theme or attendee demographic does not aligns with my company goals and therefore they wouldn't sponsor my participation, I will ask you to do so. 
Regardless of whether or not my employer covers the cost of my appearance at your event, you must provide me with a full pass for all the days of the event.

If your event is a significant time zone change from me (Central European Time, UTC+2), I do ask that my arrival flight be booked to arrive a day or two before my speaking slot and maybe leave 1 day after speaking, I like to explore!

In any case you will need to cover only conference-related direct expenses, I will cover all other costs for my extra stay.

If you reimburse me for travel and accomodation, I will be very happy and if my finances allow it I will donate it to a charity, so please let me know if you want me to donate to a specific cause (subject to my final decision) and I will send you proof of my donation.

### Fees

Since speaking at events is typically part of my job or I very much enjoy it, I do not generally require a speaking fee.

However, I do require a speaking fee if the event is a large-scale corporate one where the organizing entity stands to make a profit through it, or if it's a private/internal corporate event where the general public does not have access (paid or unpaid).

My fee is negotiable based on the size of the event, the topic, time needed for preparation work and whether or not I am a keynote speaker.

### Intellectual Property

You may record or stream my event, but I retain ownership over the content of the talk and the right to give the talk at other events at my discretion. 

Recordings cannot be paywalled unless I give express, written permission. Which would only happen if you have paid me for a private corporate event or we have an agreement where I have at least 50% of the revenues generated reverted to me as royalties.

### Pictures & Videos

Of course you can take pictures and videos of me, you can also publish those on your social media to promote the event. I will just ask you if I can get a copy after the conf. I retain every right to re-use such images on my website, social media and other content.

I reserve the right to ask that any recording, audio or video, as well as my likeness, be taken down at any point in the future for any reason of my choosing.

### Cancellations

Cancelling a speaking engagement is something I try very, very hard to avoid. It never happened to me before. In case it happens, I will do my best to offer a remote or pre-recorded presentation. 

### Contacting Me

Reach out to me via [email](mailto:matteo@mb-consulting.dev) with the name, dates, and website for your event, as well as any confirmed speakers and an idea of what you want me to talk about. If your event fits into the corporate events category, please also include your speaker budget.

Thanks for reading!
