#### Quotes I try to live by

- "If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything." - _Ronald Coase_ 

This basically thought me to not fully believe data unless I know context and how it has been collected.

- The best code is no code at all. - [_Coding Horror blog_](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/)

I think this is self-explanatory but I'll add that before writing new code I always ask myself: "Is there a way to do this without writing (a lot of) code?". Answer is usually open source, SaaS or adapt pre-existing code. Still, I try to keep my code as simple as possible following KISS, DRY and YAGNI principles.

- "Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind." - _Brene Brown_

I try to be as clear as possible when communicating with people, with little or no space for ambiguity. I also try to be kind, but I'm not always perceived as such, truth hurts sometimes.

- "Homines dum docent discunt." / Humans learn while they teach. - _Seneca_

I learn a lot by teaching, I'm a teacher at heart and I love to share my knowledge and experience with others.
